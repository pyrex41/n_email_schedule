## Helper function to schedule an email if it's outside the exclusion window
## and in the future
## 
## As per EmailRules.md:
## - Emails should not be sent during exclusion windows
## - Emails should only be scheduled for future dates
## 
## Parameters:
##   emails: The email collection to add to (modified in-place)
##   emailType: The type of email to schedule
##   date: The date to schedule the email for
##   eewStart: Exclusion window start date
##   eewEnd: Exclusion window end date
##   today: Reference date (usually current date)
##   contactId: ID of the contact receiving the email
##   reason: Optional description of why this email is being sent
##
## Returns: true if email was scheduled, false if it was suppressed
proc scheduleEmail(emails: var seq[Email], emailType: EmailType,
                  date: DateTime, eewStart, eewEnd: DateTime,

## Calculates scheduled emails for a single contact, adhering to rules in EmailRules.md
## 
## Key rules implemented:
## - Birthday email: Sent 14 days before birth date
## - Effective date email: Sent 30 days before effective date
## - AEP email: Distributed across 4 weeks (Aug 18, Aug 25, Sep 1, Sep 7)
## - 60-day exclusion window before enrollment periods
## - State-specific rules (birthday vs effective date reference)
## - Year-round enrollment states get no emails
## - Post-exclusion window email for suppressed emails
##
## Parameters:
##   contact: The contact to calculate emails for
##   today: Reference date (usually current date)
##
## Returns: A Result containing the sequence of scheduled emails or an error

## 
## Key rules implemented from EmailRules.md:
## - Handles all individual contact email rules
## - AEP email distribution: Evenly distributes contacts across 4 weeks
## - Respects exclusion windows for each contact
## - Tries alternative weeks for AEP emails if original week is in exclusion window
## 
## Parameters:
##   contacts: Sequence of contacts to schedule emails for
##   today: Reference date (usually current date)
##
## Returns: A Result containing a sequence of email sequences (one per contact)
